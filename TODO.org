* Refactor Notes
** Simple Components
*** Refactor out similarities to create a simple gauge
*** This gauge should be reusable for temp and rpm.
*** They need to each subscribe to the appropriate sensor data
*** They need to handle extra text display options like the degree symbol
*** Refactor sensors to provide data that does not need manipulation
* Stability Issues
** Flapping
*** When a component is borked it causes the whole scene to flap
*** It would be nice to have it split up so it only retries the problem component.
*** And maybe after a couple tries some back off while displaying gauge issue in ui
*** So other gauges still operate without the bad gauge/component.
* Demo Mode
** Should be a way to use the data generators for test as a demo mode that can be toggled
* Code Notes
** When a CEL is sent in the system it is bc a code is thrown.
** When we get a CEL we need to read the codes. Then display that to the dash.
** After reading the user should have a cancel codes button.
** This will cancel the CEL and Codes Display
** In theory, this could reset the codes in the ECU as well.
