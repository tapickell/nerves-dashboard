* Data flow
** Listener
*** Connect to serial port
*** handle_info on circuits messages
*** pass to Responder
** Responder
*** receive data from listener
*** determine type of message
*** if AT pass to AtProcessor
*** if PID pass to PidProcessor
** AtProcessor
*** receives at data
*** processes data to command
*** calls correct AtCommands function
** AtCommands
*** functions for processing commands
*** returns serial data as response
**** does not interact with the connection directly
**** just returns data back through call stack
** Serial
*** Right now this does nothing
*** This could return proper serial data for responses
*** Maybe this could be the write version of the Listener
**** Not really sure at this point
