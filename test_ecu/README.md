# TestEcu

**TODO: Add description**

## System Layout

* Request Listener - GenServer that reads in serial RxData and packages a message for the handler
* Request Validation - Functions that validate incoming RxData to ensure data is actual Pid Request or AT Command
* Data Generators - Lib that pattern matches incoming messages to generate simulated data for response
* Response Sender - GenServer that sends data back over serial in response (can this be split or is it blocking waiting on resp)

## Targets

Nerves applications produce images for hardware targets based on the
`MIX_TARGET` environment variable. If `MIX_TARGET` is unset, `mix` builds an
image that runs on the host (e.g., your laptop). This is useful for executing
logic tests, running utilities, and debugging. Other targets are represented by
a short name like `rpi3` that maps to a Nerves system image for that platform.
All of this logic is in the generated `mix.exs` and may be customized. For more
information about targets see:

https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content

## Getting Started

To start your Nerves app:
  * `export MIX_TARGET=my_target` or prefix every command with
    `MIX_TARGET=my_target`. For example, `MIX_TARGET=rpi3`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
